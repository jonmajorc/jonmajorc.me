It's only right that I open up with a Hello World...

My name is Jon Major and I am a Senior Software Developer. I am located downtown Madison, WI. building awesome web and mobile applications at [Bendyworks](https://bendyworks.com/)!

You can find me on various social networks, but I am most active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jonmajorc)! You can find me there tweeting about technologies like JavaScript, React, Vue, and other web funzzies.

There is so much to say in this opening post, but it's late now and I want to get to publishing and to bed... I will have more blogs comming soon.
