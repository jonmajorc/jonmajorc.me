It's only right that I open up with a Hello World...

My name is Jon Major and I am a Senior Software Developer. I am located downtown in Madison, WI. building awesome web and mobile applications at <a class="bendyworks" href="http://bendyworks.com">Bendyworks</a>!

You can find me on various social networks, but I am most active on <a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/jonmajorc">Twitter!</a> You can find me there tweeting about technologies like JavaScript, React, Vue, and other web goodies.

There is so much I would like to say in this opening post, but it's late now and I want to get to publishing and to bed... I will have more blogs coming soon.
